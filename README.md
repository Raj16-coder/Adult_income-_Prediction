project overview

In this project, the goal is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., $50K per year) using a variety of features such as age, 
education level, occupation, and others. The dataset may be imbalanced, which is why you are applying techniques like SMOTE to address class imbalance. 
 also working with several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes,
to compare performance and find the best model for prediction. 
The project involves handling data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
